# 💉 Glucose Prediction from Framingham Heart Study Data

This machine learning project analyzes and predicts the likelihood of 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) based on health metrics, with a focus on glucose levels. It uses the Framingham Heart Study dataset and applies various classification models to assess CHD risk.

## 📁 Files Included

- `glucose_prediction.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with all code and visualizations.
- `framingham.csv` — Dataset used for training and evaluation.

## 📊 Features Used

The dataset includes features such as:
- Glucose
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure
- BMI
- Smoking Status
- And more...

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

All models are trained on scaled data and evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.

## 🔍 Notebook Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on glucose levels
- Box plots to compare glucose and heart disease presence
- Correlation heatmap
- Model training and performance evaluation

## ⚙️ Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
